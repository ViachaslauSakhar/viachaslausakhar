  ## About Me 
  I am a motivated QA Engineer with experience in web application testing. 
  My experience includes involvement in three projects where the main focus was on web testing. On these projects I was the only and first tester, which allowed me to independently       define testing methods and write test documentation.
  One of my key qualities is analytical thinking, which allows me to quickly adapt to new technologies and effectively analyze requirements and specifications. I also have good           communication skills, which helps me to interact effectively with team members and document test results.
